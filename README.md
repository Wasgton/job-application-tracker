# Job Application Tracker

### Project designed to implement C#, .NET, Entity Framework, and Clean Architecture principles in practice.

The idea is to create a simple API for registering the jobs that the user applied to during a job hunting process, 
and to track the companies that responded, along with the date and the nature of the response.
